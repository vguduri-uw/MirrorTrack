[ ] correct WB9 Canvas Assignment submission on time [none]: 
[X] completed 09-workbook.txt in the for_student folder correctly [none]: 
[X] (at least one) texture you made by painting (described in the readme) [none]: I made the texture for the bump map in google drawing 
[X] (at least one) texture you found on the web (described in readme with proper attribution) [none]: The image for the skybox was taken from a git repo by fegennari called 3DWorld
[X] (at least one) a texture you made by taking a picture (described in the readme) [none]: Its my samsung tablet for the 09-01-01
[X] identifyable as a real object [09-01-01]: 
[X] texture makes it look like a real object [09-01-01]: 
[X] an appropriate scene (objects, lighting, …) [09-02-01]: 
[X] clear use of mat prop map [09-02-01]: 
[X] material map use explained [09-02-01]: this sphere is used to demonstrate how to use a texture map to show variation in metalness
[X] appropriate scene (objects and lighting) [09-03-01]: 
[X] bump map object looks “bump mappy” [09-03-01]: 
[X] confirm bump map is a bump map (1 channel) [09-03-01]: 
[X] normal map object looks “normal mappy” [09-03-01]: 
[X] confirm normal map is a normal map (3 channels) [09-03-01]: 
[X] explaination of how we can see the effects [09-03-01]: the normal map is a golf ball type of texture that i got from medium.com and the bump map is something i freehand drew.
[X] both 4-1 and 4-2 look like a skybox [09-04-01]: 
[X] 4-1 is a fake sky box (get close to edge) [09-04-01]: 
[X] there is a reflective object in the scene that shows the environment map [09-05-01]: 
[X] environment map matches environment [09-05-01]: 
[X] explanation of why env map is appropriate [09-05-01]: using a cube is the easiest way to see if the reflection from all sides of the sky box matches the environment
[X] there are shadows [09-06-01]: 
[X] there are shadows of one object onto another object [09-06-01]: 
[X] there is an object reflecting the environment (checks for code using current framework) [09-07-01]: 
[X] the reflections show the scene (not just the background) [09-07-01]: 
[X] you can see moving objects in the reflection [09-07-01]: 
[X] not the same as the example (checks for code using current framework) [09-07-01]: 
[X] combine bump/normal with color map, with explanation [09-03-01]: from certain angles the sphere's black spots seem like they have no texture vs the red parts having the same golf ball texture. the more the color contrast the easier it is to see the textures.
[X] combine env map with other map types and explain [09-05-01]: I used a bump map and made it reflective to reflect the environment of the skybox
[X] video screen showing what a camera moving in the scene sees [09-07-01]:
